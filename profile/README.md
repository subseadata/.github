# Welcome to the Subsea Data Collective!

This is a community-driven resource for anyone who works along the subsea data lifecycle to improve access to distributed data resources, aiming to enhance at-sea operational planning, cruise execution, and post-cruise data utilization.

A community wiki page is maintained at [https://github.com/subseadata/community/wiki](https://github.com/subseadata/community/wiki) with documentation, resources, and links to subsea data tools. The community repository also hosts discussions and requests for new tools. Find out more on the [wiki](https://github.com/subseadata/community/wiki).
